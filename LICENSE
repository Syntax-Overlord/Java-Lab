Look, I don't really care what you do with this code. Use it, copy it, modify it, sell it for millions (though good luck with that). Just don't come crying to me if it breaks something.

This code comes with absolutely no warranty. If it crashes your computer, starts World War 3, or makes your coffee taste bad, that's on you.

Basically: Take whatever you want from this repo. It's all just practice code anyway.

Have fun with it.
