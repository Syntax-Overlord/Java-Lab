# Java Lab

By Syntax-Overlord

## What's this?

Just a random collection of Java projects I make when I'm bored or trying stuff out. Nothing fancy here.

## Why Java?

Because it's hella easy. Took me like 6 hours to learn from basics to OOP. Not even kidding.

## What's in here?

Random side projects that I code for fun. Might be games, random algorithms, or just weird experiments. Who knows.

## Can I use this?

Sure, use whatever you want from this repo. It's all just practice code anyway.

## Note

Most of this stuff is just me messing around and learning. Don't expect production-ready code or anything professional.
